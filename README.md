## GREENLOOP

🏙 In many urban communities, good intentions often meet poor systems. People want to recycle, but don’t know where or how. Others sort their waste, only to struggle with inconvenient drop-offs. And even the most motivated eco-warriors rarely get recognition for their efforts.

That’s why Rosamond Patricia Selamat Lie, Jonathan William, Rayya Al Ghazali, Verlica Teo, and I created GreenLoop —a digital platform designed for our Software Engineering and Agile Methodology course to improve waste management through technology. GreenLoop allows users to:

♻ Schedule waste pickups from their phones
📦 Sort trash by category and input weight before pickup
🎯 Earn points and rewards for eco-friendly behavior
📚 Learn through educational features to boost recycling awareness

Under the guidance of our lecturer, Mr. Anderies Notanto. Eng., S.Kom., M.Kom. and Mrs. Irma Kartika Wairooy S.Kom., M.T.I., we applied key software engineering principles—using the Agile SCRUM framework to manage development, employing design and requirement models to shape the solution, ensuring system reliability and security, and leveraging modern tools like React.js, Laravel, and MySQL to deliver a functional MVP.
